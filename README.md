# MNIST
 This is the repo where you can train your own feed forward neural network on the MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 60 000 handwritten digits in very pixelated format. The original uploaded file (FFNN_Classification) reaches > 98.0 accuracy on unseen data. After training, the final parameters (W, b) for each layers are saved in a file. I then load these params in a separate jupyther file and load my own homewritten 28x28 pixel digits in Paint. Then I run my own digit (in form of flattened vector) through the layers via feedforward to produce a prediction. Finaly I see how accurate my model is on predicting the right digit in various ways. Now you can do the same for your digit or tune the model to have other data as input and then save the model. Have fun!
